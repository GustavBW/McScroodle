Legend:
x/X = level of aug / invo
n/N = any (amount)
Y/N/W/G - Aug/invo = is implimented: Yes, No, Works!, Groundwork laid


Abstract:
Augments and Invocations are, for all intents and purposes, permament additions to towers.
Augments applies to the bullets, /what/ the turret shoots.
Invocations applies to the towers themselves, /how/ they shoot or other things.
Names are derived as to be able to be combined. Augs first then Invo's for the towers name. Besides a couple (like slow field)

Possible Augments:
W - Piercing 1,2,3, bullets will penetrate the first target and hit up to x more enemies in a straight line behind the target
W - Hellfire 1,2,3, targets hit will take 20 * x % of b.dmg + x over 3 seconds on top of original bullet damage
W - Icicle 1,2,3, targets hit have their mvmtspd reduced by 20 * x % for 3,3,3 seconds. Does not stack with itself on the same target.
W - Explosive 1..5, the bullet explodes hitting all enemies in a tbd * x range around the initial target.
W - ChainLightning. The bullets spawn chain lightnings dealing damage and triggering on-hit
W - Lightning. After some delay, a lightning strikes the enemy dealing max hp dmg.


INVOCATIONS
All towers have a "basic" attack invocation at start
When a tower reaches max rank in a stat, it gets to choose from 3 different invocations related to that stat.
Stats considered: DMG, RNG, SPD.
Background colors related to stats: DMG: Red, RNG: Green, SPD Blue
Invocations for DMG is: Shotgun, Ray, DoomRay, Spinner, Burster
Invocations for RNG is: Slowfield, Healing Aura, Hellfire Planes
Invocations for SPD is: Multishot, Sniper


 Possible Invocations:
W - Shotgun (grape shot), fires sprays of 4,5,6 untargeted bullets dealing 1/10 dmg to all enemies hit
W - Multishot 2..N, the tower attacks op to X additional enemies for 100 - ((x - 1) * 15) % damage*
W - Slow Field (Aura) 1,2,3, slows enemies by 20 * x % whilest inside a radius of tbd/tbd/tbd
G - Ray 1,2,3, tower no longer shoots bullets but a long continous ray.**
G - Doom Ray , no levels requires Ray N, Ray damage ramps up by 10% each 5/atkspd seconds.
G - Burster 1,2,3 the tower, when firing the main bullet, follows up with x extra during atkDelay * 0.5 seconds. Each extra bullet deals 60 - (x * 10) % damage
G - Spinner 1..N the tower shoots x * 4 untargeted bullets in all directions evenly
G - Mass'ive. X bullets orbits around the tower dealing X * tower dmg. Orbiting speed scales with Tower atkspd. Orbit is half of tower range.
G - Hellfire Planes. The tower will, in intervals of atkspd, put out areas that burn enemies. Each area lasts X seconds.
N - Healing Aura. The tower will, in intervals of atkspd, heal nearby towers for
G - Sniper. Tower atkspeed becomes 0.1. Tower damage is increased by the atk spd removed as %.
*All towers have, functionally, multishot 1.
**In terms of implimentation, this is done through setting the tower's atkspd to 10, reducing dmg to 1/10th and using the "Ray" bullet with a lifetime of 1/10
