Wobbler - High health low speed slime which happily gobbles up any turrets in it's path
Smolderling - Fiery little bugger who's fast as fuck, explodes on death
Whimp - Walks fast then slow, then fast, then slow... Pretty annoying. When they're walking fast they can't attack
Qackle - Pretty tanky. Jumps then stands still for a while then attacks if possible, repeat. Got a short range but can get annoyed when pelleted upon.
